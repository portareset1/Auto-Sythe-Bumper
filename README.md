# Auto-Sythe-Bumper
This user script will allow the user add threads to a "thread watch list" by pressing the "Insert key" and it will check every 5 minutes if the thread have more than 4 hours since the last bump, to bump it automatically.

The script runs if the user is on the sythe.org main page and you can add the specific threads by visiting them and pressing insert (doing this will bump the thread for the very first time and will add the thread to the list after that)

It was made in JavaScript for Tampermonkey 4.11 userscript manager
